## DEEP LEARNING APPROACHES IN FACE RECOGNITION USING TENSORFLOW 

This my the graduation project about machine learning

It is written in python and uses the tensorflow framework

For this project I have used Google's tensorflow package for face model

`facerec.ipynb` and `facerec2.ipynb` are the same notebooks
but they use different datasets in their steps

There are two dataset folders "dataset" and "dataset2"
dataset2 folder has the same pictures but with the face extracted
because one of purposes of the research was to see how
face extraction algorithms can improve face recognition
